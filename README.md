Sounds for my youtube videos.

### About
This is my attempt to store bits and pieces for creating some youtube videos.

### Sound
I have recorded the voice and the music separately.  
And used [Audacity](https://www.audacityteam.org/) to combine those as multiple tracks.  

### Video
Most of the animated videos are generated algorithmically using my own library I have created [panim](https://github.com/NISH1001/panim).  
Others might be casual video capture from camera or some flip animation I might have done in my leisure time.

### Script
I love doing scripting (fun part of programming, I guess).  
I have used:
- [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/),
- bash scripts
- python scripts for my library

### Note
The repo might be heavy as I haven't really added any `gitignore` since I intend this repo to be a rigid archive for my later life 
to be able to look without confusion.

### Contributions
- Suggestions are welcome. Do email me at nishanpantha@gmail.com for some feedback.
- If any idea on music/video/animation, do create `issue` with the title starting with **IDEA:**. We might collaborate. :)
